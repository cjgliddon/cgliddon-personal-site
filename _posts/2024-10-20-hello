Welcome to my personal site. I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at MIT. I am currently working on a project exploring the relationships between weather predictability and climate with Dr. Talia Tamarin-Brodsky.

In addition to my scientific work, I am a composer, jazz pianist, and general music aficionado.
